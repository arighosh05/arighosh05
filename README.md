<h1 align="center">Hey there! 👋 I'm Aritra</h1>

I'm a CS major, digital explorer, and a problem-solving enthusiast navigating the matrix one keystroke at a time. 🚀

### What You'll Find Here:
- 🔭 **Projects**: From AI that tries (and sometimes succeeds) to predict the future to game engines that make pixels dance.
- 🧩 **Code Experiments**: Little nuggets of curiosity, math puzzles, and algorithms for fun (and learning).
- 🛠️ **Tools & Scripts**: Handy bits that might save you a few clicks or a forehead slap. 

### Tech I'm Into:
- **C++** (for the love of speed 🏎️)
- **Python** (for the love of brevity 🐍)
- **Machine Learning** (because teaching computers new tricks is fun 🤖)

### Random Facts:
- My bug fixes have a 50% success rate on the first try. (Not bad, right?)
- If I'm not coding, I'm probably thinking about coding. Or eating pizza. 🍕

Feel free to poke around, star what you like, or suggest improvements. I'm all about growing and sharing knowledge in this infinite loop of life. 

Let's build something cool together! 🌍👩‍💻
